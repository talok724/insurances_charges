# Healthcare Insurance Expenses Forecasting Using Predictive Modeling

## Project Overview

In the contemporary world, individuals strive to secure a joyful and worry-free future by investing in various avenues like mental well-being, physical health, and healthy dietary habits. However, unforeseen illnesses often result in substantial medical expenses that disrupt these efforts. Healthcare expenses, including medical treatments, medications, and tests, continue to rise, adding financial burdens on families.<br>

To mitigate these burdens, health insurance serves as a crucial safeguard. By paying a nominal insurance premium, individuals gain the assurance of being prepared for medical emergencies. However, given the wide range of treatment costs and the potential for fraudulent claims, forecasting an appropriate insurance premium is a challenge for providers.<br>

This project focuses on **forecasting healthcare insurance expenses** for individuals and families using **predictive modeling** techniques. The goal is to create a model that predicts insurance premiums based on various factors and provide insights to insurance providers about appropriate coverage amounts to offer to customers.<br>

## Problem Statement

The cost of medical procedures is unpredictable, and individuals often face anxiety about not having enough funds for unforeseen medical expenses. Health insurance helps mitigate these risks, but the cost of premiums varies significantly based on several factors. The challenge is to accurately forecast the insurance premium for an individual or family based on personal characteristics and medical history to ensure adequate coverage without overcharging or underpricing.<br>

## Data Collection

The dataset used in this project contains information about individuals, including personal details, health conditions, and medical history. Data attributes include:<br>

- **Age**: Age of the insured individual<br>
- **Gender**: Gender of the insured individual<br>
- **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: Indicator of obesity<br>
- **Children**: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance<br>
- **Smoker**: Whether the individual is a smoker (yes/no)<br>
- **Region**: Geographical region of the individual<br>
- **Medical History**: Medical conditions of the individual<br>
- **Insurance Premium**: The target variable – the cost of the insurance premium<br>

## Methodology

To predict healthcare insurance expenses, we apply **predictive modeling techniques**, including:<br>

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.<br>
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features, normalizing/standardizing data, and feature selection.<br>
- **Model Selection**: Experimenting with multiple algorithms, such as:
  - Linear Regression<br>
  - Random Forest Regressor<br>
  - Gradient Boosting Machines<br>
  - Support Vector Machines<br>

## Features and Target Variable

- **Features**:<br>
  - Age<br>
  - Gender<br>
  - BMI<br>
  - Children<br>
  - Smoker status<br>
  - Region<br>
  - Medical history<br>
- **Target Variable**:<br>
  - Insurance Premium<br>

## Modeling Techniques

The project uses a variety of regression models to predict insurance premiums. We apply techniques such as:<br>

- **Linear Regression**: A simple model for estimating relationships between features and the target variable.<br>
- **Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble method for better accuracy and handling non-linear relationships.<br>
- **Gradient Boosting**: A boosting method for improving the model performance by combining weak models.<br>
- **Support Vector Machines**: A powerful model for non-linear data.<br>

## Evaluation Metrics

We use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of the models:<br>

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average of the squares of the errors.<br>
- **R-squared (R²)**: Represents the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the features.<br>
- **Adjusted R²**: Adjusted version of R² that accounts for the number of predictors in the model.<br>

## Results

The project explores various model architectures and compares their performance using evaluation metrics. A well-performing model can be used to forecast insurance premiums accurately, helping insurance providers optimize their pricing strategy and prevent financial setbacks due to underpricing or overpricing.<br>
